# Machine-Learning--Basic
Pla-Linear Regresion-Non Linearity
In my implementations, I decided to design the building blocks of the whole
questions and keep re-using them. Therefore, there are some specific functions
which are thoroughly used in almost all questions in the project. On the
other hand, in order to make the code more dynamic, I decided to write an
argument parser in order to make executions more easy. The end user only
needs to change some specific arguments in the command line in order to
execute different questions.
